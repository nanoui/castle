  "Description": " The Hotel du Bois Blanc is only a few minutes away from Vonnas; but in the heart of its huge 15 hectare park you can unwind. Immersed in greenery, the new hotel of Georges Blanc is a place apart, with its red walls which are reminiscent of the ochre hues of Château d’Epeyssoles nearby, creating a little corner of Tuscany in the heart of Bresse. The large rooms, all on the same level, with walk-in showers and a private terrace, surround a nice pool heated during the season and are an invitation to well-being. Only a few steps lead to the restaurant of the château, La Terrasse des Étangs, set up under a glass roof and opening onto the park, its century old oak trees and its two ponds.",
